### Section 1: About This Project

Challenge 2, the Portfolio project culminates all HTML & CSS learned during the EDX University of Toronto Bootcamp. This is  a prototype of the eventual portfolio that will be made later in the EDX University of Toronto Bootcamp.

### Section 2: Getting Started

Building my website required 3 key elements, Wireframing, Programming, and Mobile Version Porting.

**What are the 3 Key Elements**

Wireframing:

This project required me to make concept art for the website's design the final version was inspired by Michael Jackson's "Invincible"  album cover art.
I designed all website branding by myself in Adobe Photoshop, as required to match my desired aesthetic.

```
Programming:
relying on the given documentation, and further research I was able to find all the pieces of code to make my design choices work.
```
```
Mobile Version Porting:
This involved me re-sizing the elements on the page to fit on a smaller screen and removing elements to improve the mobile experience.
This is the first time I have written a program that is made to work on several devices, and it was interesting to work within the limitations presented by smartphones. 
```
