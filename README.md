### Section 1: About This Project

Challenge 1, the Horiseon increase of accesbility project is about making the webpage more accesible; which means to increase screen reader support, through the use of HTML Semantics.

### Section 2: Getting Started

To start on the project all HTML div statements must be replaced by their respective HTML Semantics, and all images given an alt, and replace the coressponding .CSS code.

**What are the Replacements:**

HTML Semantics:

Statments that describe the kind of content being read by a Screen-Reader they guide the reader's focus.

(eg.)

header

nav- Handles a the website navigation bar

section- Creates a section where objects  may be placed. 

article

aside- Everything in the side bar, that is not the main focuse of a page.

footer


```
Alt:
Text describing an image that is displayed if an image does not display on the browser.
```
```
Changing CSS:
In order to apply the same visual properties, as the div statements, the new Semantic statements must be assigned as the parent of the visual property's class.
```
